embeddedsw.git - repo for standalone software

The standalone software is divided into following directories:
	- lib
		contains bsp, software apps and software services
	- license.txt
		contains information about the various licenses and copyrights
	- doc/ChangeLog
		Contains change log information for releases
	- XilinxProcessorIPLib/drivers
		contains all drivers
	- ThirdParty
		software from third party like light weight IP stack
	- mcap/linux
		software for using MCAP interface on Ultra Scale boards to
		program 2nd level bitstream
	- cmake
		Contains common functions which will be consumed by CMakeLists.txt file
	- scripts
		Contains linker templates and spec files for various processors

Every driver, sw_apps and sw_services has one or more of these sub-directories:
1. data		- contains tcl, mdd, testapp tcl or header files used in Vitis and contains yaml and .cmake files used in Yocto Flow.
2. doc		- documentation of source code in form of pdf or html 
3. examples	- illustrating different use cases of driver
4. src		- driver interface code implementing functionality of IP

Building FSBL from git:
==============================
FSBL(zynq_fsbl/zynqmp_fsbl) has 3 directories.
	1. data - It contains files for Vitis and Yocto flow
	2. src  - It contains the FSBL source files
	3. misc - It contains miscellaneous files required to
		  compile FSBL.
		  For zynq (zynq_fsbl), builds for zc702, zc706, zed are supported.
		  It also contains the ps7_init_gpl.[c/h] with gpl
		  header in respective board directories.
		  For zynqmp (zynqmp_fsbl), builds for zcu102,zcu102-es2 board are
		  supported.
