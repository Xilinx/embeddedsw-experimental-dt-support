/**
* @file xiic_dynamic_eeprom_example.c
*
* This file consists of a Interrupt mode design example which uses the Xilinx
* IIC device and XIic driver to exercise the EEPROM in Dynamic controller mode.
* The XIic driver uses the complete FIFO functionality to transmit/receive data.
*
* This example writes/reads from the lower 256 bytes of the IIC EEPROMS. Please
* refer to the datasheets of the IIC EEPROM's for details about the internal
* addressing and page size of these devices.
*
* The XIic_DynMasterSend() API is used to transmit the data and
* XIic_DynMasterRecv() API is used to receive the data.
*
* This example is tested on ML300/ML310/ML403/ML501/ML507/ML510/ML605/SP601 and
* SP605 Xilinx boards.
*
* The ML310/ML410/ML510 boards have a on-board 64 Kb serial IIC EEPROM
* (Microchip 24LC64A). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on
* this board.
*
* The ML300 board has an on-board 32 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC32A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM has to be connected to ground for this example.
* The WP is connected to pin Y3 of the FPGA.
*
* The ML403 board has an on-board 4 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC04A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on this board.
*
* The ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605 boards have an on-board 8 Kb serial
* IIC EEPROM(STM M24C08). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground
* on these boards.
*
* The AddressType for ML300/ML310/ML410/ML510 boards should be u16 as the
* address pointer in the on board EEPROM is 2 bytes.
*
* The AddressType for ML403/ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605 boards should
* be u8 as the address pointer for the on board EEPROM is 1 byte.
*
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML300/ML310/ML403/ML410/
* ML501/ML505/ML507/ML510 boards is 0x50.
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML605/SP601/SP605 boards
* is 0x54.
* Refer to the User Guide's of the respective boards for further information
* about the IIC slave address of IIC EEPROM's.
*
* The define EEPROM_ADDRESS in this file needs to be changed depending on
* the board on which this example is to be run.
*
* This code assumes that no Operating System is being used.
*
* @note
*
* None.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date	 Changes
* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a mta  04/13/06 Created.
* 2.00a ktn  11/17/09 Updated to use the HAL APIs.
* 2.01a ktn  03/17/10 Updated the information about the EEPROM's used on
*		      ML605/SP601/SP605 boards. Updated the example so that it
*		      can be used to access the entire IIC EEPROM for devices
*		      like M24C04/M24C08 that use LSB bits of the IIC device
*		      select code (IIC slave address) to specify the higher
*		      address bits of the EEPROM internal address.
* 3.4   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
