description: The FreeRTOS lwIP Echo Server application provides a simple demonstration of how to use the light-weight IP stack (lwIP) with FreeRTOS. This application sets up the board to use IP address 192.168.1.10 or IPv6 address FE80:0:0:0:20A:35FF:FE00:102, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. The server listens for input at port 7 and simply echoes back whatever data is sent to that port.
