type: apps

description: The FreeRTOS LwIP TCP Perf Client application is used for creating TCP client and measure TCP uplink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10 and IPv6 link local address whenipv6_enable is true, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02.
